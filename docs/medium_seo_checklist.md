# Medium SEO + distribution checklist (practical)

## Subtitle

- Say **what it is** + **who it’s for** + **why now**
- Example: “A systems-first blueprint for adaptive retrieval routing in agentic RAG.”

## First 2 sentences (critical)

- Sentence 1: the pain (“static retrieval breaks in agents due to compounding errors”)
- Sentence 2: the promise (“learned retrieval = routing + eval loop + telemetry”)

## Tags (pick 5)

- Retrieval-Augmented Generation
- Machine Learning Systems
- Data Engineering
- Information Retrieval
- AI Agents

## Headings

- Make headings **nouns** (components) and **trade-offs** (failure modes)
- Prefer 6–8 sections, short paragraphs

## CTA placement

- One CTA after the architecture section (“diagram + repo”)
- One CTA in the conclusion (“run it locally; extend with your evaluator”)

## “Proof” section (near end)

- Repo: `beyond-vector-search` (toy but runnable)
- Architecture diagram included
- Next: evaluation loop + learned router

## Distribution

- LinkedIn: post the diagram + 2 bullets + repo link
- Comments: add a “what I’d measure” list as the first comment
